Linear Algebra
==============

The coefficient matrix is sparse and highly structured. With the exception of
the :math:`A` and :math:`A^T` blocks, all block are either zero or diagonal.

For for solving the sparse symmetric positive definite linear systems using the
sparse Cholesky factorization some subroutines from Ng-Peyton library are use.
