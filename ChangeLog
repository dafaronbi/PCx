	* Fixed bug in memory allocation for array min_phi in PCx.c

2004-11-05

	* Fixed hash.c to allow more than 1.3 million rows and columns;
	
	* redefined allowable hash table sizes.

2004-03-19
	* Fixed minor bugs concerning handling of upper bounds (in PCx.c) and
	scaling (in scale.c).
	
	* Unified the unix and Matlab-ready distributions.

2003-05-11

	* Updated PCx-C (C version) to use latest version of fortran-to-C
	utility f2c.

2003-04-11

	* Fixed another bug in preprocessor, again concerning row singletons.

2002-02-28

	* Fixed bug in preprocessor for bounded variables in a singleton row.

2002-02-26

	* Updated PCx-AMPL interface to fix some bugs in the interface, and
	document the installation process more thoroughly.

	* Also created precompiled executables for Intel Solaris, Sun Solaris,
	and Linux.

2001-12-23

	* Fixed handling of "MI" in the BOUNDS section of MPS files; affects
	only cases in which MI variables have upper bounds other than 0.

2001-02-27

	*  A few fixes in line search heuristic and MPS file handling; affects
	only a few cases.

2000-12-14

	* Fixed readmps.c to avoid core dumping on incorrect MPS input files.

1999-09-13

	* Bug fix in PCx Unix and  C versions.
	
	* Bug affected instances with bound constraints in whch Gondzio
	correctors were used.

1999-08-12

	* Unix and C versions changed to accept problems with zero rows in the
	constraint matrix, and to improve efficiency of initial matrix ordering
	routines. (We are working on improvements to the dense column handling,
	which will be released shortly.)

1998-08-06

	* AMPL interface and PCxGUI (Java interface) released.

1998-06-10
