PCx is an interior-point predictor-corrector linear programming package. The
code has been developed at the Optimization Technology Center, which is a
collaboration between Argonne National Laboratory and Northwestern University.
Nowadays it is mainly developer under supervision of Aurelio Ribeiro from
University of Campinas.

PCx is designed as a stand-alone solver. Because of its modular structure and
fairly transparent data structures, it is not too difficult to integrate into
your application.

The documentation can be found at `DOC and instructions of how install
PCx at `DOC/install.rst`.

IMPORTANT NOTE
--------------

Over the years when PCx was been developing at the Optimization Technology
Center some user ported it to some architectures/operations systems and wrote
interface for programming languages like Matlab, AMPL and Java.

Nowadays we are only supporting the x86-64 architecture in the GNU/Linux
operation system and have deprecated all interfaces other than C.
