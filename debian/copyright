The PCx authors sometimes change the sources without bumping the
version number.  This package was based on sources dated Jan 10, 2006.

Comment by the Debian maintainer: 

        This package is in "non-free" because the PCx license (below)
        does not meet paragraph 1 of the Debian Free Software
        Guidelines: it can be distributed for free (e.g. via ftp
        archives), but incorporating PCx into a product for sale
        requires a commercial purchase.  The notification requirement
        does apply to vendors who want to include the PCx package in a
        cdrom for sale.  The sale price for PCx is $1,000 a copy as of
        Oct. 1, 1998.  Discounts for multiple copy purchases are
        available and may be applicable.
